I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. thesis on <b>robot path planning and replanning algorithms for coverage tasks</b>. My current research focuses on combinatorial planning algorithms with approximation guarantees for robots in uncertain environments. 

More recently, my interests are in using <b>learning-based algorithms for robot planning under uncertainty</b>, mainly reinforcement learning (RL) and diffusion policies.

Before my Ph.D., I obtained my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Alberta. During my undergrad, I worked on side-projects involving robotics, specifically towards automating dangerous tasks. Two notable projects were developed at large student hackathons and won top-three prizes.

<b>I am currently looking for postdoctoral employment as a researcher/developer in robotics and AI.</b>
